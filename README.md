# My Portfolio Website (Work in Progress)

This is a personal portfolio website I'm building from scratch to showcase a few projects.
I made a deliberate choice to build this little static site using **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Sass** instead of a front-end framework. This approach allows me to demonstrate foundational understanding of core web technologies and keeps the project lightweight and performant.
