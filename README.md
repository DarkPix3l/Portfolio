# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch to showcase a selection of my projects.

I made a deliberate choice to build this little static site using **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Sass** instead of a front-end framework. This approach allows me to demonstrate foundational understanding of core web technologies and keeps the project lightweight and performant.


## Wireframes

Basic wireframes were designed in Figma to plan layout and interactions:

-  **Error Handler** Handles content or data errors gracefully to prevent the app from breaking.
